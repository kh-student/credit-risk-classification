# credit-risk-classification

## Background
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Objectives
**1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets**

**2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data**

**3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report**

Data used to train and evaluate the model will be stored in ```lending_data_csv```. 

Code used to train and evaluate the model can be found in the ```credit_risk_classification.ipynb``` file.
